				<title>The purpose of this module</title>
				<p>
				One of the purposes of real analysis is to prove that the laws of calculus are valid. Rather than using the "plausible" geometric reasoning you may have met in school mathematics, real analysis aims to reduce the laws of calculus to simple logical statements which can be verified by a human or even a computer. With this foundation in hand, one can go beyond calculus and give logical answers to questions such as the following:
				<ul>
					<li>What is the density of rational numbers between 0 and 1?<fn>The answer is 0, see MATH314 Lebesgue Integration.</fn></li>
					<li>What is the density of prime numbers in  <m>1,2, \dots, N</m>?<fn>The answer is <m>1/\log N</m>, see  MATH328 Number Theory.</fn></li>
					<li>If one repeatedly samples a statistic, what shape does the resulting bar chart take?<fn>This question is answered by the "law of large numbers", see MATH313 Probability Theory.</fn></li>
				</ul>
Although these questions are not answered in this course, we lay the logical foundations which allow one to answer these questions in future courses.

 If you would like to refresh you knowledge of logic and proof, I recommend reading the first 20 pages of the following <url

<title>Learning outcomes</title>
<p>
Having worked through this course, you should be able to:
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
	Give rigorous logical <em>definitions</em> of concepts from calculus, such as "limit", "continuous", "differentiable". For instance:
		<ul>
			<li>
			Define the supremum of a set of real numbers.
			</li>
			<li>Define what it means for a real number to be the limit of a sequence of real numbers.
			</li>
			<li>Define what it means for a real-valued function on an open interval to be continuous.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	Use logical <em>proof</em> to establish properties of the above concepts, for example:
		<ul>
			<li>
	Prove that every differentiable function on an open interval is continuous.
			</li>
			<li>
	Prove that every continuous function on a closed interval is uniformly continuous.
			</li>
			<li>
	Show that if <m>S \subset \R</m> is non-empty and bounded then
				<me>
	(\forall n \in \N)(\exists a_n \in S)\sqbrac{a_n + \tfrac{1}{n} \geq \sup S }.
				</me>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	Construct <em>counterexamples</em> to illustrate why certain assumptions are necessary, for instance:
		<ul>
			<li>
	Construct a continuous function on an open interval which is not differentiable.
			</li>
			<li>
	Construct a continuous function on an open interval which is not uniformly continuous.
			</li>
			<li>
	Construct a set <m>S \subset \R</m> which is non-empty, but for which
				<me>
	(\exists n \in \N)(\forall a \in S)\sqbrac{ a  + \tfrac{1}{n} \lt \sup S }.
				</me>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
We will consider few, if any, "calculation" questions. This is because our learning outcomes (see above) are concerned with becoming fluent in the  rigour and logic required to articulate definitions and proofs in analysis, they are not about performing computations. Unfortunately, this is also one of the reasons why analysis can be hard to learn, at least initially. There are a number of reasons why it is important to become proficient in this rigour and logic:
<ul>
	<li>The rigour and logic of analysis underlies much of mathematics; without it we may convince ourselves that <m>1=2</m>, and this would have consequences for those subjects which rely on the accuracy of mathematics<fn>It is often argued that without mathematics, engineers would not be able to guarantee the safety of their bridges.</fn>.
	</li>
	<li>
	Many of your future modules in mathematics build on the foundation laid down in real analysis: learning this foundation now makes your future courses <em>much</em> easier.
	</li>
	<li>
	As a mathematician, you should want to know whether you have proved something or not: if one believes one has proved the Riemann hypothesis<fn>Perhaps the most famous unsolved problem in mathematics, with a \$1,000,000 reward.</fn> then one would like to be able to check your argument before telling the world about it.
	</li>
	<li>
	In order to understand your ideas, other mathematicians need to be able to read and verify your work.
	</li>
	<li>
	In your future work, your employer may hire you on your ability as a mathematician to construct logical arguments.
	</li>
</ul>
