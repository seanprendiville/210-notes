					</li>
					</ol>
					<proof>
					<p>
We first prove the result for the division rule, the arguments for the inequality rule, addition rule and the multiplication rule being similar (and easier, hence left to the reader). 
					</p>
					<p>
					Since inequalities spread around a limit (<xref ref="cor-non-zero-cts"/>), there exists a neighbourhood <m>N</m> of <m>x_0</m> such that for all <m>x\in D\cap N</m> we have <m>f_2(x)\neq 0</m>. Let <m>(a_n)_n</m> be a sequence in <m>D \cap N</m> with <m>a_n\to x_0</m>. By definition of function limits (<xref ref="def-fn-lim"/>), we are required to show that <m>f_1(a_n)/f_2(a_n)\to y_1/y_2</m> as <m>n\to\infty</m>. By our assumption <xref ref="eq-finite-fn-lim"/> and the definition of function limit (<xref ref="def-fn-lim"/>), we have <m>f_i(a_n)\to y_i</m> for both <m>i=1,2</m>. Hence combining the multiplication rule (<xref ref="prop-mult-rule"/>) and reciprocal rule (<xref ref="prop-recip-rule"/>) for sequential limits, we obtain
					<me>
					\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{f_1(a_n)}{f_2(a_n)} =  \lim_{n\to \infty}f_1(a_n)\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{1}{f_2(a_n)}= y_1\frac{1}{y_2}					</me>,
as required.
					</p>
					<p>
					Next we prove the composition rule. Let <m>(a_n)_n</m> be a sequence in <m>D</m> which tends to <m>x_0</m> through <m>D</m>. By definition of the function limit (<xref ref="def-fn-lim"/>), we are required to prove that <m>g( f_1(a_n))\to z</m> as <m>n\to\infty</m>. By our assumption <xref ref="eq-finite-fn-lim"/> and the definition of function limit (<xref ref="def-fn-lim"/>), we have <m>f_1(a_n)\to y_1</m>. Since <m>g</m> tends to <m>z</m> as <m>y</m> tends to <m>y_1</m> through <m>f_1(D)</m>, it follows that <m>g \brac{f_1(a_n)}\to z</m> as <m>n\to\infty</m>, as required.
					</p>
					<p>
					The absolute value rule follows from the composition rule, taking <m>g</m> to be the absolute value function <m>g(y) := |y|</m>, which is continuous (<xref ref="eg-abs-cts"/>), hence <m>g(y)\to |y_1|</m> as <m>y\to y_1</m> through <m>f_1(D)</m>.
					</p>
					<p>
					For the minimum rule, we first observe that the function <m>g(x) := \min\set{x,0}</m> is continuous on <m>\R</m>. To prove this one can establish the inequality <m>|g(x_1)-g(x_2)|\leq |x_1-x_2|</m> then (e.g.) take <m>\delta(\eps) = \eps</m> in the epsilon-delta characterisation of continuity. By the addition and multiplication rules, we have that 
					<me>
					f_1(x) - f_2(x) \to y_1-y_2 \quad \text{as} \quad x\to x_0\quad\text{through}\quad D.
					</me>
					Hence, using the composition rule with <m>g</m>, we see that
					<me>
					\min\set{f_1(x) - f_2(x),0} \to \min\set{y_1-y_2,0} \quad \text{as} \quad x\to x_0\quad\text{through}\quad D.
					</me>
					Using the identity
					<me>
					\min\set{a,b} = \min{a-b,0}+b
					</me>,
					together with the addition/multiplication rules, we deduce the minimum rule. The maximum rule follows from a similar argument.
					</p>
</proof>
</proposition>	
<corollary>
<statement>
Let <m>f,g : D\to \R</m> and <m>h:f(D) \to \R</m> all be continuous. Then <m>f+g, fg, h\circ f, |f|, \min\set{f,g}, \max\set{f,g}</m> are all continuous.
</statement>
</corollary>
<example xml:id="prop-poly-cts">
<title>Polynomials are continuous</title>
Given <m>c_0, c_1, \dots, c_n \in \R</m> define
<me>
f(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \dots + c_n x^n
</me>.
Then the polynomial <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>\R</m>.
<proof>
 The identity function <m>x \mapsto x</m> is continuous, since denoting this function by <m>f</m>, we have <m>a_n \to x_0</m> implies <m>f(a_n) \to f(x_0)</m>.
 By the multiplication rule (<xref ref="prop-mult-rule"/>) it follows that <m>x^2</m> is continuous.
 Iterating this argument, we see that <m>x^3 = x\cdot x^2</m> is continuous.
 It follows from induction that <m>x^n</m> is continuous for any <m>n \in \N</m>.
 Since constant functions are continuous (<xref ref="eg-const-cts"/>), it again follows from the multiplication rule that <m>c_n x^n</m> is continuous for any <m>c_n \in \R</m>.
 By the addition rule (<xref ref="prop-add-rule"/>), the sum
<me>
c_0 + c_1x+ \dots + c_n x^n
</me>
is continuous.
 Hence polynomials are continuous.

<example xml:id="eg-square-not-unif-cts">
<title>Continuity does not imply uniform continuity</title>
<p>
 Define <m>f : \R \to \R</m> at each <m>x \in \R</m> by <m>f(x) := x^2</m>.
 Then <m>f</m> is a polynomial, so is continuous on <m>\R</m> by <xref ref="prop-poly-cts"/>.
 By way of contradiction, suppose that <m>f</m> were uniformly continuous on <m>\R</m>. 
 Taking <m>\eps := 1</m> in the definition of uniform continuity (<xref ref="def-unif-cts"/>),  there exists <m>\delta \gt 0</m> such that if <m>|x_1 - x_2| \leq \delta</m> then <m>|x_1^2 - x_2^2| \leq 1</m>.
 Setting <m>x_2 := x_1 + \delta</m>, we deduce that for any <m>x_1 \gt 0</m> we have

1 \geq |x_1^2 - x_2^2| = |x_1-x_2||x_1+x_2| = \delta (2x_1+\delta) \geq \delta x_1.

 The domain of a function is important for uniform continuity: the function <m>f(x) = x^2</m> is not uniformly continuous on <m>\R</m>, yet one can show that it is uniformly continuous on any closed interval <m>[a,b]</m> (see <xref ref="thm-unif-cts"/>).

  Applying the same argument to the sequence <m>(y_{k(n)})_n</m>, there exists <m>y_0\in [a,b]</m> and  <m>\ell_1 \lt  \ell_2 \lt  \dots</m> such that <m>y_{k(\ell_n)} \to y_0</m> as <m>n \to \infty</m>.

 Since this is a contradiction, it follows that <m>f</m> must indeed be uniformly continuous.

<title>Intermediate value theorem</title>
<statement>
 Let <m>f : [a,b] \to \R</m> be a continuous function on a closed interval <m>[a,b] \subset \R</m>.
 For any real number <m>y</m> between<fn>i.e. if <m>f(a) \leq f(b)</m> then <m>f(a) \leq y \leq f(b)</m>, whilst if <m>f(a) \gt f(b)</m> then <m>f(a) \geq y \geq f(b)</m>.</fn> <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m>, there exists <m>x \in [a,b]</m> such that <m>f(x) = y</m>.
</statement>
<proof>
<p>
We prove the result assuming that <m>f(a) \leq y \leq f(b)</m>; if <m>f(a) \geq y \geq f(b)</m> then we reduce to the former case on considering <m> -f</m>.
 Set
<me>
x := \sup\set{t \in [a,b] : f(t) \leq y}.
</me>
 The above supremum exists because the set is non-empty (it contains <m>a</m>) and is bounded above by <m>b</m>. In particular, <m>a \leq x \leq b</m>.
 We claim that <m>f(x) = y</m>.
 </p>
 <p>
If it is not the case that <m>f(x)\leq y</m>, then <m>f(x)\gt y</m>. It follows that the function <m>g(t):=f(t)-y</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and has <m>g(x) \gt 0</m>. Since positivity spreads around a positive limit, there exists <m>\delta \gt 0</m> such that for all <m>t\in [a,b]\cap[x-\delta, x+\delta]</m> we have <m> f(t)-y = g(t) \gt 0</m>. Since decreasing a supremum gives a non-upper bound, there exists <m>t\gt x-\delta</m> with <m>f(t) \leq y</m>. But then <m>t \in [a,b]\cap[x-\delta, x+\delta]</m>, and so we obtain the contradiction that
<me>
y \geq f(t) \gt y
</me>. 
 </p>
 <p>
 It remains to show that <m>f(x) \geq y</m>. By way of contradiction, suppose that <m>f(x) \lt y</m>. It follows that the function <m>h(t):=y-f(t)</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and has <m>h(x) \gt 0</m>.
  Since positivity spreads around a positive limit, there exists <m>\delta \gt 0</m> such that for all <m>t\in [a,b]\cap[x-\delta, x+\delta]</m> we have <m> y- f(t) = h(t) \gt 0</m>. Notice that if <m>b\leq x+\delta</m>, then <m>b \in [a,b]\cap[x-\delta, x+\delta]</m> and hence <m>f(b)\lt y</m>, which is a contradiction. Thus <m>b\gt x-\delta</m>. In particular, <m>x+\delta \in [a,b]\cap[x-\delta, x+\delta]</m> and so <m>f(x+\delta) \lt y</m>. However the latter contradicts the fact that <m>x</m> is an upper bound for the set of <m>t\in [a,b]</m> satisfying <m>f(t)\leq y</m>. Thus <m>f(x)\geq y</m>, as required.

 The function <m>x \mapsto x^n</m> is continuous on the closed interval <m>[0, 1+a]</m>, by <xref ref="prop-poly-cts"/>.
 One can check that

0^n \leq a \leq (1+a)^n.

 Let <m>f : [a,b] \to \R</m> be a continuous function.
 Then there exist <m>x_1,x_2 \in [a,b]</m> such that
<me>
f(x_1) = \inf_{[a,b]} f \quad \text{and} \quad f(x_2) = \sup_{[a,b]} f.
</me>
 In particular, a continuous function on a closed interval is bounded.
 </statement>

<proof>
<title>Proof (non-examinable)</title>
 We prove the result for the supremum, the argument for the infimum being similar.
 Notice that the supremum <m>
 \sup_{[a,b]} f
</m>
is either real or equal to <m>\infty</m>. We first discount the latter situation.
 If <m>\sup_{[a,b]} f = \infty</m> then for any <m>n \in \N</m> there exist <m>x_n \in [a,b]</m> with <m>f(x_n) \gt n</m> (otherwise <m>n</m> is a finite upper bound for <m>f</m>).
 By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, there exists <m>k_1 \lt  k_2 \lt  \dots</m> such that the subsequence <m>x_{k_n}</m> tends to a real limit <m>x_0</m> for some <m>x_0 \in \R</m>.
 By the inequality rule (<xref ref="prop-ineq-rule"/>) we have <m>x_0 \in [a,b]</m>.
 By continuity (<xref ref="def-cts"/>) and the inequality rule (<xref ref="prop-ineq-rule"/>) we have
<me>
f(x_0) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_{k_n}) \geq \lim_{n \to \infty} k_n = \infty.
</me>
 This is a contradiction, since <m>f(x_0)</m> is a real number.
 It follows that the supremum is finite.
 Since decreasing a supremum gives a non upper bound (<xref ref="prop-alt-sup"/>), for each <m>n \in \N</m> there exists <m>x_n \in [a,b]</m> such that 
<me xml:id="eq-sup-sand">
\brac{\sup_{[a,b]} f}-\recip n \lt  f(x_n) \leq \sup_{[a,b]} f.

 Since the set <m>[a,b]</m> is bounded, the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem (<xref ref="cor-bolzano"/>) gives the existence of <m>k_1 \lt  k_2 \lt  k_3 \lt  \dots</m> such that the subsequence <m>x_{k_n}</m> converges to some <m>x_0 \in [a,b]</m>.
 Since <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>x_0</m>, the sequential definition of continuity (<xref ref="def-cts"/>) gives that
<me>
f(x_0) = \lim_{n\to \infty} f(x_{k_n}).
</me>
 By the sandwich rule (<xref ref="prop-sandwich"/>), we deduce that
<me>
f(x_0) = \sup_{[a,b]} f.
